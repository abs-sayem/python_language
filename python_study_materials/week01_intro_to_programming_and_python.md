---

### Slide 01: Course Introduction

* **Course Title**: Introduction to Python Programming for Civil Engineers
* **Instructor**: \[Your Name]
* **Week 1 Topic**: Introduction to Programming and Python
* **Objective**: Understand the basics of programming and how Python fits into civil engineering applications.

---

### Slide 02: Why Learn Programming?

* Solve real-world problems efficiently
* Automate repetitive tasks
* Analyze large datasets (e.g., survey data, structural data)
* Essential for modern engineering practices (simulation, modeling, analysis)

---

### Slide 03: What is Python?

* High-level, interpreted programming language
* Easy to learn and use
* Open-source and free
* Huge community and support
* Popular in academia and industry

---

### Slide 04: Applications of Python in Civil Engineering

* Structural analysis automation
* Survey data processing
* Quantity estimation
* Visualization of data (graphs, charts)
* Finite element modeling (basic level)

---

### Slide 05: Setting Up Python

* Option 1: Google Colab (browser-based, no installation)
* Option 2: Anaconda with Jupyter Notebook (recommended for local use)
* Option 3: VS Code (advanced usage)

---

### Slide 06: First Python Program

```python
print("Hello, Civil Engineers!")
```

* `print()` is used to display output
* Text inside quotation marks is called a string

---

### Slide 07: Python Syntax Basics

* **Comments** start with `#`
* **Indentation** defines blocks of code
* Case-sensitive language
* No semicolons needed

---

### Slide 08: Variables and Data Types

```python
name = "Sayem"
age = 25
height = 5.8
is_student = True
```

* Data types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
* Variable naming rules and conventions

---

### Slide 09: Input and Output

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```

* `input()` for user input
* Output using `print()`

---

### Slide 10: Simple Math in Python

```python
a = 10
b = 3
print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Power:", a ** b)
print("Division:", a / b)
```

* Basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`

---

### Slide 11: Week 1 Lab Tasks

* Install or access Python environment
* Write and run your first Python program
* Practice variable assignment and printing values
* Try simple math operations and input/output

---

### Slide 12: Summary

* Programming helps solve problems and automate tasks
* Python is simple, powerful, and widely used
* Youâ€™ve learned basic syntax, variables, input/output, and math
* Ready for control structures next week!
